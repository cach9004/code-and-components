# code-and-components
A place to store all progress made toward our finished product

This readme is intended for TAs, CAs, profs, team members or others who want to understand and/or utilize the code.

Download the following files from our repo:
bin
public
routes
views
app.js
package.json
package-lock.json

The navigate to the file location of all these files. The bin, public,, routes, views files should all be within their respective folders.

Then run sudo npm install to install necessary packages for node.. It may give you an error that all files are downloaded already because I have included the package folder with a lot of the necesssary packages.

Once this is done, run "npm start" and go to localhost:3000 in your browser to use the code.
